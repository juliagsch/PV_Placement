""" 
Creates a dataset consisting of building patches in Switzerland. 

One sample consists of a folder named {lon_min}_{lat_min}_{lon_max}_{lat_max} where min and max mark the bounds of the patch.

The folder consists of:
-   roof.obj file representing the building's roof as a mesh
-   surroundings3D.obj file representing the surroundings of the building as a mesh. This is used by the simulator.
    Faces lower than the building roof are not represented as they are irrelevant for shading.
-   surroundings2D.csv file representing a grid of elevation points of the patch. This could be used for model training.
-   mask.csv file representing a mask of the surroundings grid indicating which points correspond to the roof. Could also be used for model training.

Important: Coordinates are provided in LV95 format (Swiss Coordinate System).
If you would like to view buildings on maps, please convert them to GPS coordinates using 
https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/coordinates-conversion-navref

In our format, the x axis represents longitude, y axis represents latitude and the z axis represents elevation.
